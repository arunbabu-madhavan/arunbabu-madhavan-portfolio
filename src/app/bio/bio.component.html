<div>You can call me <span>Arun</span>, I build websites. I am an award winning web developer with 6 years of proven performance in software development. I like to design and develop apps, games and architect enterprise solutions with good design patterns. I designed and developed this website 
from scratch using Angular. Designs are inspired from personal websites of many talented UI/UX developers.

I started coding from a young age and I spend most my day thinking and 
coding which I really love to do. When I am not coding, I watch Anime, read books (novels and comics - thrillers are my favorite) and play video games.</div>
